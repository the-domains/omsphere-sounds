            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Biography</h1><p>Omsphere (Jay OM / Journey / Sonic Wave Control) is the progressive solo project of, Milan born but now London based, Giampiero 'Jay' Mastino, label manager of Free-Spirit Records.Jay forged his earliest psychedelic-rock influences playing guitar in local bars in Milan. His romance with the decks began in the late 80's whilst working for a local radio station where he was given the opportunity to spin his first record. This love firmly in place the move to London followed in 1998. Soon thereafter in 1999 he started djing professionally as Jay OM and in 2003 he studied Sound Engineering and Music Technology and began a solo production project under the name Journey and another collaborative project called Star~Trip. In 2009 he started producing progressive under the name Omsphere.In 2004, Jay conceived the vision of a network of like-minded artists in the psy-trance, progressive and ambient genres, all working to promote themselves and each other under one banner. Thus the Free-Spirit label was born... originally intended to focus on artist management, the label's skyrocketing success combined with the enthusiasm of Jay, the artists and fans enabled Free-Spirit to outgrow its horizons.Jay released his debut solo Omsphere EP, Earthling, in November 2010 followed by a collaborative EP with Solar Spectrum, The Earthlings, in May 2011. He has also released tracks on several other international labels and also has numerous releases under his other projects. Jay has been rocking the crowds at many of the biggest venues internationally as well as outdoor parties and festivals in the UK, Europe, Brazil and South Africa under his various projects including Boom Festival, Universo Paralello, Origin Festival, Fora do Tempo Festival, Aurora Festival, Vortex Festival, Boomerang Festival, Psionic Visions Festival, Sonica Festival, Samsara Festival, Life Celebration Festival and many more...Jay also produces progressive under the name Omsphere, has a further psychedelic collaborative project with Ralph K (Braincell/Solar Spectrum/Rastaliens) called Crocodile Rangers and in January 2012 formed a progressive tribal trance project called Sonic Wave Control. HIs debut album, Sixth Sense, was released on Free-Spirit Records in April 2012.Today, Jay's reputation as an active, involved and hard-working individual in the global trance circuit precedes him. His commitment and enthusiasm for trance music has left an indelible impression on the world scene already and Jay's future has never looked brighter, from his burgeoningly successful record label to his organized events to his upcoming solo releases. Jay works tirelessly at his art and trade and the music he brings to the masses exemplifies the fruits of his labour and energy.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dc742ba4-6518-4d2a-8f57-44c11fd6c3d2.jpg"></article>]]></description>
